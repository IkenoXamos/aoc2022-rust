# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust

This is a small project intended to re-implement many of the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) that I have [already implemented](https://github.com/IkenoXamos/aoc2022) in TypeScript in Rust for the purposes of learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and for fun.

I'll be leveraging [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to manage some tedium.
